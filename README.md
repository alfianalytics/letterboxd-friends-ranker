# Letterboxd Profile Analyzer, Friends Ranker, and Movie Recommendations
A Streamlit app where you can identify your movie-watching behavior, rank your friends, and get movie recommendations based on the movies of your friends by scraping your Letterboxd data.
Accessible at [letterboxd-friends-ranker.streamlit.app](https://letterboxd-friends-ranker.streamlit.app)

## Profile Analyzer
The analysis of your profile includes:
- the time (year, decade) your movies were released in
- your ratings and the average Letterboxd' user ratings on your movies
- popularity and likeability of your movies
- your top directors and actors
- your top genres and top genre combinations

## Friends Ranker & Movie Recommendation
It will scrape your friends, your friends' movies, calculate the similarity based on the movies you both have watched and then generate movie recommendations based on the movies that your friends have watched
